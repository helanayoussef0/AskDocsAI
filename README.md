# AskDocsAI

## Overview

AskDocsAI is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload a document via a drag-and-drop feature and ask questions related to its content. The application will parse and analyze the document, leveraging AI to provide relevant answers.

### Problem

Many professionals and researchers work with large documents but struggle to extract relevant information efficiently. Instead of manually scanning through pages, AskDocsAI enables users to query their documents and receive instant answers.

### User Profile

- Students and educators looking for quick insights from academic papers.
- Professionals reviewing lengthy reports or contracts.
- Researchers analyzing large text datasets.
- Casual users who need a fast way to retrieve information from documents.

### Features

### MVP Features (2-week timeline)

- Drag-and-drop document upload (initially supporting .txt files).
- AI-powered Q&A based on document content.
- Clean, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Animated interactions using Framer Motion.

### Future Enhancements

- Support for additional file types (.pdf, .docx, etc.).
- User authentication and document history.
- Improved AI performance with document summarization.
- Integration with cloud storage (Firebase, AWS S3, etc.).

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React
- Tailwind CSS (styling option)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Styled-Components (alternative styling option)

### Backend

- Node.js & Express (API server)
- Knex.js (SQL query builder
- MySQL (database for storing user queries and document metadata)
- fs (File System) (handling file uploads)

### AI Integration Options (Ranked)

1. Steamship (Preferred)
    - Provides easy-to-use APIs for AI-based document analysis.
    - Fast setup and good developer support.
2. OpenAI API (GPT-based Q&A)
    - High-quality language model but may have rate limits.
    - Requires API key management and cost considerations.
3. LangChain + Local LLM (e.g., Llama 2 or GPT-4-All)
    - Ideal for privacy-focused applications.
    - Requires additional infrastructure for hosting the model.
